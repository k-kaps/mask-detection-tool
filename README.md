# Mask Detection Tool
This is the repository for the Mask Detection Tool, a lightweight software for detecting if a user is wearing a face mask or not using traditional computer vision techniques.

## Motivation
After completing my internship at L&T Technology Services Ltd. in May 2020, I wanted to apply the skills I had learnt in the field of computer vision to the COVID-19 Pandemic. I felt that developing a Mask Detection Tool was a great way of applying these skills and also gaining deeper knowledge in CV, and hence developed the tool in the June -July 2020 period.
